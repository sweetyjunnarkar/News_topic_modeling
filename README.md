# News_topic_modeling

The data was pre-processed with the removal of stop words, punctuation and numbers, and the words were stemmed using the Lemmatization.

The data was vectorized into a TF-IDF matrix, then LDA techniques were applied and topic modeling is visualized by pyLDAvis.

Experimented with NMF and LSA to get relevent topics.
